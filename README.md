# Unbillable

Repo for my talk about Android IAB.

## Slides

My slides are done in Remark.js which is a markdown-based Javascript presentation framework. The easiest way to use this is to command line to the public folder and run 'python -m SimpleHttpServer' then point your browser at localhost:8000. More info on Remark at https://github.com/gnab/remark

## Code

There is some code for a Candy Crush PoC that demonstrates how exploting the API works.
